# remove-unmatched-array-from-another-parent-array-using-js
js : here two different js array are matched and fetched unmatched array element as an array. That means two array  compared and finally unmatched array element are return as an array

Guide line : 
Main array element are contains into  'mainArry'
Example: ["1","2","3","4","5","6"];

Removable array element as an array 'minusArray'
Example: ["3","1",'8',"4","7"];

Here i need to remove all elements which are contains into minusArray , these are "3","1",'8',"4","7" . These element can be matched with Main array or overflowed but if these element are exist then i need to remove these element from mother array. Our mother array is "1","2","3","4","5","6". Where 2,5,6 are unmatched so this is the ultimate result we need. 

Remember : minusArray has more element which are not matched with main Array element but we need only unmathed array element from main array element, thats why we ignore
